/*
Allow PLUMED to use collective variables computed in the MD engine.

This feature requires the MD engine to use special instructions to pass to PLUMED the value of
some pre-computed collective variable. Check the documentation for the MD code to find out which
collective variables can be computed and passed to PLUMED. These variables can then be accessed by
name using the EXTRACV action.

This example takes the lambda variable pre-computed in GROMACS and applies a restraint to keep
it close to the value 3.

```plumed
l: EXTRACV NAME=lambda
RESTRAINT ARG=l KAPPA=10 AT=3
```

With the updated GROMACS 2026 patch, `lambda` is the integer alchemical state
index (`init-lambda-state`), not an individual Coulomb or van der Waals coupling
parameter. In an expanded-ensemble simulation (`free-energy=expanded`), biases
on this variable enter GROMACS's MCMC transition probabilities. The host evaluates
all candidate states without depositing hills, writing ordinary output, or
changing the MD forces. Metadynamics can therefore bias lambda alone or together
with configurational variables, as in alchemical metadynamics
([Hsu et al., JCTC 2023](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c01258)).

For native lambda replica exchange, the updated patch uses
`GREX setLocalInput lambda` so that the parameter stays with its local Hamiltonian
when the foreign coordinates are evaluated. This command must be issued on every
rank of the replica; it marks a scalar MD input as local to that replica.
This requires the corresponding PLUMED 2.11 kernel. ENERGY-dependent biases
additionally require the foreign physical energy described in [ENERGY](ENERGY.md).
