This repository contains my own public branches.

To get the official plumed versions, please refer to the repository at http://github.com/plumed/plumed2

Below you can see the content of the local branches. These branches will be merged to official plumed repository
as soon as they are ready for production.

* _master_ branch: this README file.

* _v2.0-hrex_ branch: an implementation of Hamiltonian replica exchange for GROMACS.
There is an alternate GROMACS patch and a script to edit topologies. Both are preliminary and might not work with
all GROMACS settings. If you with to use it, I suggest you to get in touch with me (bussi@sissa.it)

* _walkers-mpi_ branch: an implementation of multiple walkers based on MPI. Only works with GROMACS.
